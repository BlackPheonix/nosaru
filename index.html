                    <p>
                    I first met Osaru at one of my prayer meetings in school then called Courage and friends. She was invited by our mutual friend Lydia who was her roommate at the time. I had no idea that she would be my wife at the time, which was 2016. </p>

                    <p>Moving forward to 2020, we were still friends and were both done with school. I wanted to expand my business, so I opened a new studio in an available space close to her residence.   She came around, and assisted me with the support I needed to set up my studio. On one of those days, the thought of her being my wife struck my heart like a flash.
                        
                        I had to set out some time to pray about it. </p>

                       <p>My convictions became stronger but I needed to be sure, as I didnt want to spoil our good friendship with "marriage talk". 
                        
                        I spoke to some friends to join in prayers and then I intentionally began to check for qualities I was looking for in a wife, and of course the first one was obviousâ€” she really loves the Lord.</p> 

                    <p>                              
                        It took me about six months of praying, waiting and getting to know her better before I proposed a relationship to her. It took her a little over 6 months to give me a concrete answer.
                        
                        We got engaged on the 20th of February 2022, and all I can say is that it was worth the wait. </p>
                        

                        <p>Like i said to her in july of 2021, Can we do this forever walk together? </p>
